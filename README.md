# ftAPI - WORK IN PROGRESS :construction:

WORK IN PROGRESS!
*   Need tests
*   Nil values in ftapi.json response examples decodes to interface{} type, which isnt good. But can't be helped at this stage as the 42 API Docs don't provide accurate json schemas. If these fields would be used, they need to be type asserted first.

An API client for the 42 API.
